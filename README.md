Goofy-Ahh Name Generator 0.0.1
Created by moldbun

*****************

Welcome to the Goofy-Ahh Name Generator. This program has the simple objective of
taking in a name, and making it goofy.

As the program is currently in alpha, bugs are highly likely. While there are
currently thousands of possible combinations for unique names, the generator
only has minimal combinations at this time. As further iterations are developed,
names will truly become random and unique.

***INSTRUCTIONS***
-Open the .bat file to run the program.

-Added function to take in user input and modify the original input to a goofy name.
